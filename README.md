Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Here, you will find all the projects completed during my journey at 42, an innovative coding school renowned for its peer-to-peer learning environment and emphasis on practical programming skills.

All of my projects completed at 42 can be found within this repository. These projects cover a wide range of topics and technologies, showcasing my growth as a programmer throughout the program. I coded mainly in C and C++ but I also did some projects on Virtual Machines and by using Docker for example. 

Feel free to explore my projects and guides, and I hope they prove helpful in your own coding journey !
